# How to Install and Upgrade Spec Kitty

Use this guide to install the Spec Kitty CLI and upgrade existing projects.

## Release Tracks

- **Recommended (`main` / PyPI 1.x stable)**: install from PyPI (`spec-kitty-cli`)
- **Forward track (`2.x`)**: GitHub-only releases (`v2.*.*`) for next-generation testing

## Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install spec-kitty-cli
```

```bash
uv tool install spec-kitty-cli
```

## Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty.git
```

```bash
uv tool install spec-kitty-cli --from git+https://github.com/Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty.git
```

## One-Time Usage

```bash
pipx run spec-kitty-cli init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

```bash
uvx spec-kitty-cli init <PROJECT_NAME>
```

## Upgrade Existing Projects

Run upgrades from the project root so templates and automation stay in sync.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
spec-kitty upgrade
```

Preview changes before applying them:

```bash
spec-kitty upgrade --dry-run
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
spec-kitty --version
```

## Verify Spec Storage Health

After upgrading to v0.16.0+, verify that spec storage (orphan branch) is correctly configured:

```bash
spec-kitty verify-setup
```

If the spec worktree is not healthy, re-run init to repair:

```bash
spec-kitty init --here --force
```
